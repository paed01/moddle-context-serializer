Changelog
=========

# 2.1.0

Activity data associations

## Additions:
- add activity behaviour property `dataInputAssociations` holding a list of the same
- add activity behaviour property `dataOutputAssociations` holding a list of the same

# 2.0.0

Handle participants add add participant information to message flows. To reduce CPU footprint the api is prototyped.

## Breaking:
- returned api is prototyped
- second argument passed to extendFn and result of `getExtendContext` is now an instance of ExtendContext. Hence, you are not able to deconstruct `addScript` and/or `addTimers` functions anymore.

## Additions:
- add participant id and name to `bpmn:MessageFlow`
- elements are exposed in new api elements property
- expose participants in elements property
- add lane information to activity

# 1.0.0

No breaking but used in production.

# 0.16.0

Scripts and timers again.

- Add context `getExtendContext` function to get scripts and timers and an ability to add some more

## Bugfix
- deserialized context without scripts or timers breaks when trying to retreive them

# 0.15.0

Extract scripts and timers.

## Additions:
- Extracts all known scripts into an array that can be retreived by `getScripts` or `getScriptsByElementId`
- Extracts all known timers into an array that can be retreived by `getTimers` or `getTimersByElementId`

## Breaking

# 0.5.0

## Deprecated
The following functions will be removed in next minor version:

- `getErrorById(errorId)` is no longer needed since `getActivityById(errorId)` returns errors as well
- `getErrors()` will be removed since errors are not stored in a separate list anymore. Combine `getActivities()` with type filter for the same result
